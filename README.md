## Building
```sh
git clone https://github.com/pixelcmtd/CXClient.git
```

Open Eclipse with `/path/to/CXClient/eclipse` as the workspace, add a new Java
Project called "Client", export that project as `Runnable Jar File`.

## Installing
Grab a build, extract the folder (called something like `cxclient_x.y`) into
your Minecraft folder's subdirectory `versions`. Depending on your OS your
Minecraft folder is different:

| OS      | Path                                      |
|---------|-------------------------------------------|
| Linux   | `~/.minecraft`                            |
| macOS   | `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\.minecraft`                    |

If you want to use your own build, replace the JAR file inside the
folder (usually called something like `cxclient_x.y.jar`) with your own one.

## Updating
We planned an updater and now it is technically easily possible, but...we won't
do it! There are reasons, you can find them [here](UPDATER.md). For pure
updating you can just put the new folder there and change your profile in the launcher.
